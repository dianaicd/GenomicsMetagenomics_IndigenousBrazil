  title: Demographic history of oceania inferred from genome-wide data
  container-title: Current Biology
  page: '1983-1992'
  volume: '20'
  issue: '22'
  abstract: 'Background: The human history of Oceania comprises two extremes: the
    initial colonizations of Near Oceania, one of the oldest out-of-Africa migrations,
    and of Remote Oceania, the most recent expansion into unoccupied territories.
    Genetic studies, mostly using uniparentally inherited DNA, have shed some light
    on human origins in Oceania, particularly indicating that Polynesians are of mixed
    East Asian and Near Oceanian ancestry. Here, we use ∼1 million single nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) to investigate the demographic history of Oceania in a more
    detailed manner. Results: We developed a new approach to account for SNP ascertainment
    bias, used approximate Bayesian computation simulations to choose the best-fitting
    model of population history, and estimated demographic parameters. We find that
    the ancestors of Near Oceanians diverged from ancestral Eurasians ∼27 thousand
    years ago (kya), suggesting separate initial occupations of both territories.
    The genetic admixture in Polynesian history between East Asians (∼87%) and Near
    Oceanians (∼13%) occurred ∼3 kya, prior to the colonization of Polynesia. Fijians
    are of Polynesian (∼65%) and additional Near Oceanian (∼35%) ancestry not found
    in Polynesians, with this admixture occurring considerably after the initial settlement
    of Remote Oceania. Our data support a greater contribution of East Asian women
    than men in the admixture history of Remote Oceania and highlight population substructure
    in Polynesia and New Guinea. Conclusions: Despite the inherent ascertainment bias,
    genome-wide SNP data provide new insights into the genetic history of Oceana.
    Our approach to correct for ascertainment bias and obtain reliable inferences
    concerning demographic history should prove useful in other such studies. 2010

  abstract: Large-scale genetic analysis of the native inhabitants of Rapa Nui (Easter
    Island) reveals the expected combination of Polynesian ancestry with later European
    admixture, but also a contribution from Native Americans dating to 1280–1495 AD,

  volume: '4'
  abstract: Available evidence strongly suggests that the first to settle on Rapa
    Nui were Polynesians arriving from the west around AD 1200-1253. There are, however,
    also signs of an early contact between Rapa Nui and South America, but genetic
    evidence of an early contribution of Native Americans to the peopling of Rapa
    Nui has until recently been lacking. In this review our own genetic studies of
    blood-derived DNA collected on Rapa Nui since 1971 are summarized. For the first
    time human molecular genetic data are obtained which strongly suggest that some
    Native Americans arrived early at Rapa Nui, probably as early as AD 1280-1495.
    Whether they sailed directly from South America to Rapa Nui on their own rafts
    or whether they came with Polynesians returning from visits to South America cannot
    be established by our studies, but the latter possibility may be the most likely
    given other evidence of early visits by Polynesians to South America. In any case,
    our data suggest that some Native Americans arrived Rapa Nui not long after its
    first settlement by Polynesians, but long before the island was discovered by
    Europeans in 1722. Native Americans may therefore have had an influence on the
    early human colonization of Rapa Nui and thus on its ecology.

  title: Estimating individual admixture proportions from next generation sequencing
    data
  container-title: Genetics
  page: '693-702'
  volume: '195'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Inference of population structure and individual ancestry is important
    both for population genetics and for association studies. With next generation
    sequencing technologies it is possible to obtain genetic data for all accessible
    genetic variations in the genome. Existing methods for admixture analysis rely
    on known genotypes. However, individual genotypes cannot be inferred from low-depth
    sequencing data without introducing errors. This article presents a new method
    for inferring an individual’s ancestry that takes the uncertainty introduced in
    next generation sequencing data into account. This is achieved by working directly
    with genotype likelihoods that contain all relevant information of the unobserved
    genotypes. Using simulations as well as publicly available sequencing data, we
    demonstrate that the presented method has great accuracy even for very low-depth
    data. At the same time, we demonstrate that applying existing methods to genotypes
    called from the same data can introduce severe biases. The presented method is
    implemented in the NGSadmix software available at http://www.popgen.dk/software.

  abstract: Whole-genome studies have documented that most Native American ancestry
    stems from a single population that diversified within the continent more than
    twelve thousand years ago. However, this shared ancestry hides a more complex
    history whereby at least four distinct streams of Eurasian migration have contributed
    to present-day and prehistoric Native American populations. Whole genome studies
    enhanced by technological breakthroughs in ancient DNA now provide evidence of
    a sequence of events involving initial migrations from a structured Northeast
    Asian source population with differential relatedness to present-day Australasian
    populations, followed by a divergence into northern and southern Native American
    lineages. During the Holocene, new migrations from Asia introduced the Saqqaq/Dorset
    Paleoeskimo population to the North American Arctic ∼4500 years ago, ancestry
    that is potentially connected with ancestry found in Athabaskan-speakers today.
    This was then followed by a major new population turnover in the high Arctic involving
    Thule-related peoples who are the ancestors of present-day Inuit. We highlight
    several open questions that could be addressed through future genomic research.

  issue: '7626'
  abstract: The appearance of people associated with the Lapita culture in the South
    Pacific around 3,000 years ago marked the beginning of the last major human dispersal
    to unpopulated lands. However, the relationship of these pioneers to the long-established
    Papuan people of the New Guinea region is unclear. Here we present genome-wide
    ancient DNA data from three individuals from Vanuatu (about 3,100-2,700 years
    before present) and one from Tonga (about 2,700-2,300 years before present), and
    analyse them with data from 778 present-day East Asians and Oceanians. Today,
    indigenous people of the South Pacific harbour a mixture of ancestry from Papuans
    and a population of East Asian origin that no longer exists in unmixed form, but
    is a match to the ancient individuals. Most analyses have interpreted the minimum
    of twenty-five per cent Papuan ancestry in the region today as evidence that the
    first humans to reach Remote Oceania, including Polynesia, were derived from population
    mixtures near New Guinea, before their further expansion into Remote Oceania.
    However, our finding that the ancient individuals had little to no Papuan ancestry
    implies that later human population movements spread Papuan ancestry through the
    South Pacific after the first peopling of the islands.

  abstract: We have shown previously that the AKT2 pathway is essential for cell survival
    and important in malignant transformation. In this study, we demonstrate elevated
    kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80
    primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen
    receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates
    ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated
    by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional
    activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen.
    Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate
    a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin,
    abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced
    by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen
    but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha
    contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to
    the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol
    in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation
    of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These
    data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha)
    may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute
    to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.

  title: Genetic evidence for two founding populations of the Americas.

  page: '104-8'
  volume: '525'
  issue: '7567'
  abstract: Genetic studies have consistently indicated a single common origin of
    Native American groups from Central and South America. However, some morphological
    studies have suggested a more complex picture, whereby the northeast Asian affinities
    of present-day Native Americans contrast with a distinctive morphology seen in
    some of the earliest American skeletons, which share traits with present-day Australasians
    (indigenous groups in Australia, Melanesia, and island Southeast Asia). Here we
    analyse genome-wide data to show that some Amazonian Native Americans descend
    partly from a Native American founding population that carried ancestry more closely
    related to indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andaman Islanders than to
    any present-day Eurasians or Native Americans. This signature is not present to
    the same extent, or at all, in present-day Northern and Central Americans or in
    a ∼12,600-year-old Clovis-associated genome, suggesting a more diverse set of
    founding populations of the Americas than previously accepted.

  abstract: This review commemorates the 40th anniversary of DNA sequencing, a period
    in which we have already witnessed multiple technological revolutions and a growth
    in scale from a few kilobases to the first human genome, and now to millions of
    human and a myriad of other genomes. DNA sequencing has been extensively and creatively
    repurposed, including as a ’counter’ for a vast range of molecular phenomena.
    We predict that in the long view of history, the impact of DNA sequencing will
    be on a par with that of the microscope.

  title: 'Trans-atlantic slavery: Isotopic evidence for forced migration to barbados'
  container-title: American Journal of Physical Anthropology
  page: '547-557'
  volume: '139'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: The question of the ultimate origin of African slaves is one of the most
    perplexing in the history of trans-Atlantic slavery. Here we present the results
    of a small, preliminary isotopic study that was conducted in order to determine
    the geographical origin of 25 enslaved Africans who were buried at the Newton
    plantation, Barbados, sometime between the late 17th and early 19th century. In
    order to gain a more nuanced understanding of the slaves’ origin, we used a combination
    of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and strontium isotope analyses. Carbon and nitrogen
    isotope ratios were determined in bone and dentinal collagen; oxygen and strontium
    isotopes were measured in tooth enamel. Results suggest that the majority of individuals
    were born on the island, if not the estate itself. Seven individuals, however,
    yielded enamel oxygen and strontium ratios that are inconsistent with a Barbadian
    origin, which strongly suggests that we are dealing with first-generation captives
    who were brought to the island with the slave trade. This idea is also supported
    by the fact that their carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values differ markedly
    between their teeth and bones. These intra-skeletal shifts reflect major dietary
    changes that probably coincided with their enslavement and forced migration to
    Barbados. While it is impossible to determine their exact origins, the results
    clearly demonstrate that the slaves did not all grow up in the same part of Africa.
    Instead, the data seem to suggest that they originated from at least three different
    areas, possibly including the Gold Coast and the Senegambia.

  title: Assessing the Relationship of Ancient and Modern Populations.
  container-title: Genetics
  page: '383-398'
  volume: '208'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: 'Genetic material sequenced from ancient samples is revolutionizing
    our understanding of the recent evolutionary past. However, ancient DNA is often
    degraded, resulting in low coverage, error-prone sequencing. Several solutions
    exist to this problem, ranging from simple approach, such as selecting a read
    at random for each site, to more complicated approaches involving genotype likelihoods.
    In this work, we present a novel method for assessing the relationship of an ancient
    sample with a modern population, while accounting for sequencing error and postmortem
    damage by analyzing raw reads from multiple ancient individuals simultaneously.
    We show that, when analyzing SNP data, it is better to sequence more ancient samples
    to low coverage: two samples sequenced to 0.5 coverage provide better resolution
    than a single sample sequenced to 2 coverage. We also examined the power to detect
    whether an ancient sample is directly ancestral to a modern population, finding
    that, with even a few high coverage individuals, even ancient samples that are
    very slightly diverged from the modern population can be detected with ease. When
    we applied our approach to European samples, we found that no ancient samples
    represent direct ancestors of modern Europeans. We also found that, as shown previously,
    the most ancient Europeans appear to have had the smallest effective population
    sizes, indicating a role for agriculture in modern population growth.'

    calling for ancient DNA'

  publisher: Genome Biology
  page: '224-224'
  volume: '16'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: 'Ancient DNA is typically highly degraded with appreciable cytosine
    deamination, and contamination with present-day DNA often complicates the identification
    of endogenous molecules. Together, these factors impede accurate assembly of the
    endogenous ancient mitochondrial genome. We present schmutzi, an iterative approach
    to jointly estimate present-day human contamination in ancient human DNA datasets
    and reconstruct the endogenous mitochondrial genome. By using sequence deamination
    patterns and fragment length distributions, schmutzi accurately reconstructs the
    endogenous mitochondrial genome sequence even when contamination exceeds 50 %.
    Given sufficient coverage, schmutzi also produces reliable estimates of contamination
    across a range of contamination rates. Availability: https:'

  title: Reconstructing Native American population history
  container-title: Nature
  page: '370-374'
  volume: '488'
  issue: '7411'
  abstract: The peopling of the Americas has been the subject of extensive genetic,
    archaeological and linguistic research; however, central questions remain unresolved.
    One contentious issue is whether the settlement occurred by means of a single
    migration or multiple streams of migration from Siberia. The pattern of dispersals
    within the Americas is also poorly understood. To address these questions at a
    higher resolution than was previously possible, we assembled data from 52 Native
    American and 17 Siberian groups genotyped at 364,470 single nucleotide polymorphisms.
    Here we show that Native Americans descend from at least three streams of Asian
    gene flow. Most descend entirely from a single ancestral population that we call
    ’First American’. However, speakers of Eskimo-Aleut languages from the Arctic
    inherit almost half their ancestry from a second stream of Asian gene flow, and
    the Na-Dene-speaking Chipewyan from Canada inherit roughly one-tenth of their
    ancestry from a third stream. We show that the initial peopling followed a southward
    expansion facilitated by the coast, with sequential population splits and little
    gene flow after divergence, especially in South America. A major exception is
    in Chibchan speakers on both sides of the Panama isthmus, who have ancestry from
    both North and South America.

  title: Supplementary information An Aboriginal Australian Genome Reveals Separate
    Human Dispersals into Asia
  container-title: Science
  page: '94-98'
  volume: '334'
  issue: '6052'
  abstract: We present an Aboriginal Australian genomic sequence obtained from a 100-year-old
    lock of hair donated by an Aboriginal man from southern Western Australia in the
    early 20th century. We detect no evidence of European admixture and estimate contamination
    levels to be below 0.5%. We show that Aboriginal Australians are descendants of
    an early human dispersal into eastern Asia, possibly 62,000 to 75,000 years ago.
    This dispersal is separate from the one that gave rise to modern Asians 25,000
    to 38,000 years ago. We also find evidence of gene flow between populations of
    the two dispersal waves prior to the divergence of Native Americans from modern
    Asian ancestors. Our findings support the hypothesis that present-day Aboriginal
    Australians descend from the earliest humans to occupy Australia, likely representing
    one of the oldest continuous populations outside Africa.

  title: Methods for Summarizing Radiocarbon Datasets
  container-title: Radiocarbon
  page: '1809-1833'
  volume: '59'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt; Bayesian models have proved very powerful in analyzing large
    datasets of radiocarbon ( &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; C) measurements from specific
    sites and in regional cultural or political models. These models require the prior
    for the underlying processes that are being described to be defined, including
    the distribution of underlying events. Chronological information is also incorporated
    into Bayesian models used in DNA research, with the use of Skyline plots to show
    demographic trends. Despite these advances, there remain difficulties in assessing
    whether data conform to the assumed underlying models, and in dealing with the
    type of artifacts seen in Sum plots. In addition, existing methods are not applicable
    for situations where it is not possible to quantify the underlying process, or
    where sample selection is thought to have filtered the data in a way that masks
    the original event distribution. In this paper three different approaches are
    compared: “Sum” distributions, postulated undated events, and kernel density approaches.
    Their implementation in the OxCal program is described and their suitability for
    visualizing the results from chronological and geographic analyses considered
    for cases with and without useful prior information. The conclusion is that kernel
    density analysis is a powerful method that could be much more widely applied in
    a wide range of dating applications. &lt;/p&gt;'

  title: Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans.
  container-title: Nature
  page: '87-91'
  volume: '505'
  issue: '7481'
  abstract: The origins of the First Americans remain contentious. Although Native
    Americans seem to be genetically most closely related to east Asians, there is
    no consensus with regard to which specific Old World populations they are closest
    to. Here we sequence the draft genome of an approximately 24,000-year-old individual
    (MA-1), from Mal’ta in south-central Siberia, to an average depth of 1. To our
    knowledge this is the oldest anatomically modern human genome reported to date.
    The MA-1 mitochondrial genome belongs to haplogroup U, which has also been found
    at high frequency among Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers,
    and the Y chromosome of MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and near
    the root of most Native American lineages. Similarly, we find autosomal evidence
    that MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and genetically closely related
    to modern-day Native Americans, with no close affinity to east Asians. This suggests
    that populations related to contemporary western Eurasians had a more north-easterly
    distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought. Furthermore, we estimate
    that 14 to 38% of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from
    this ancient population. This is likely to have occurred after the divergence
    of Native American ancestors from east Asian ancestors, but before the diversification
    of Native American populations in the New World. Gene flow from the MA-1 lineage
    into Native American ancestors could explain why several crania from the First
    Americans have been reported as bearing morphological characteristics that do
    not resemble those of east Asians. Sequencing of another south-central Siberian,
    Afontova Gora-2 dating to approximately 17,000 years ago, revealed similar autosomal
    genetic signatures as MA-1, suggesting that the region was continuously occupied
    by humans throughout the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings reveal that western
    Eurasian genetic signatures in modern-day Native Americans derive not only from
    post-Columbian admixture, as commonly thought, but also from a mixed ancestry
    of the First Americans.

  title: The genetic prehistory of the New World Arctic
  container-title: Science
  volume: '345'
  issue: '6200'
  abstract: The New World Arctic, the last region of the Americas to be populated
    by humans, has a relatively well-researched archaeology, but an understanding
    of its genetic history is lacking. We present genome-wide sequence data from ancient
    and present-day humans from Greenland, Arctic Canada, Alaska, Aleutian Islands,
    and Siberia. We show that Paleo-Eskimos (\~3000 BCE to 1300 CE) represent a migration
    pulse into the Americas independent of both Native American and Inuit expansions.
    Furthermore, the genetic continuity characterizing the Paleo-Eskimo period was
    interrupted by the arrival of a new population, representing the ancestors of
    present-day Inuit, with evidence of past gene flow between these lineages. Despite
    periodic abandonment of major Arctic regions, a single Paleo-Eskimo metapopulation
    likely survived in near-isolation for more than 4000 years, only to vanish around
    700 years ago.

  container-title: Science

  volume: '349'
  issue: '6250'
  abstract: How and when the Americas were populated remains contentious. Using ancient
    and modern genome-wide data, we found that the ancestors of all present-day Native
    Americans, including Athabascans and Amerindians, entered the Americas as a single
    migration wave from Siberia no earlier than 23 thousand years ago (ka) and after
    no more than an 8000-year isolation period in Beringia. After their arrival to
    the Americas, ancestral Native Americans diversified into two basal genetic branches
    around 13 ka, one that is now dispersed across North and South America and the
    other restricted to North America. Subsequent gene flow resulted in some Native
    Americans sharing ancestry with present-day East Asians (including Siberians)
    and, more distantly, Australo-Melanesians. Putative “Paleoamerican” relict populations,
    including the historical Mexican Pericúes and South American Fuego-Patagonians,
    are not directly related to modern Australo-Melanesians as suggested by the Paleoamerican
    Model.

  title: Genomic evidence for the Pleistocene and recent population history of Native
    Americans
  container-title: Science
  page: aab3884-aab3884
  volume: '349'
  issue: '6250'
  abstract: How and when the Americas were populated remains contentious. Using ancient
    and modern genome-wide data, we found that the ancestors of all present-day Native
    Americans, including Athabascans and Amerindians, entered the Americas as a single
    migration wave from Siberia no earlier than 23 thousand years ago (ka) and after
    no more than an 8000-year isolation period in Beringia. After their arrival to
    the Americas, ancestral Native Americans diversified into two basal genetic branches
    around 13 ka, one that is now dispersed across North and South America and the
    other restricted to North America. Subsequent gene flow resulted in some Native
    Americans sharing ancestry with present-day East Asians (including Siberians)
    and, more distantly, Australo-Melanesians. Putative “Paleoamerican” relict populations,
    including the historical Mexican Pericúes and South American Fuego-Patagonians,
    are not directly related to modern Australo-Melanesians as suggested by the Paleoamerican
    Model.

  issue: October
  abstract: To date the only Neandertal genome that has been sequenced to high quality
    is from an individual found in Southern Siberia. We sequenced the genome of a
    female Neandertal from \~50 thousand years ago from Vindija Cave, Croatia to \~30-fold
    genomic coverage. She carried 1.6 differences per ten thousand base pairs between
    the two copies of her genome, fewer than present-day humans, suggesting that Neandertal
    populations were of small size. Our analyses indicate that she was more closely
    related to the Neandertals that mixed with the ancestors of present-day humans
    living outside of sub-Saharan Africa than the previously sequenced Neandertal
    from Siberia, allowing 10-20% more Neandertal DNA to be identified in present-day
    humans, including variants involved in LDL cholesterol levels, schizophrenia and
    other diseases.

  title: Inference of population structure using multilocus genotype data
  container-title: Genetics
  page: '945-959'
  volume: '155'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: We describe a model-based clustering method for using multilocus genotype
    data to infer population structure and assign individuals to populations. We assume
    a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which
    is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in
    the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two
    or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model
    does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of
    the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked.
    Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure,
    assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants
    and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments
    using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using
    genotype data from an endangered bird species. The software used for this article
    is available from http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/ approximately pritch/home. html.

  title: Principal components analysis corrects for stratification in genome-wide
    association studies
  container-title: Nature Genetics
  page: '904-909'
  volume: '38'
  issue: '8'
  abstract: Population stratification–allele frequency differences between cases and
    controls due to systematic ancestry differences-can cause spurious associations
    in disease studies. We describe a method that enables explicit detection and correction
    of population stratification on a genome-wide scale. Our method uses principal
    components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and
    controls. The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker’s variation
    in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while
    maximizing power to detect true associations. Our simple, efficient approach can
    easily be applied to disease studies with hundreds of thousands of markers.

  title: Admixture, Population Structure, and F-Statistics
  container-title: Genetics
  page: '1485-1501'
  volume: '202'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Many questions about human genetic history can be addressed by examining
    the patterns of shared genetic variation between sets of populations. A useful
    methodological framework for this purpose isF-statistics that measure shared genetic
    drift between sets of two, three, and four populations and can be used to test
    simple and complex hypotheses about admixture between populations. This article
    provides context from phylogenetic and population genetic theory. I review howF-statistics
    can be interpreted as branch lengths or paths and derive new interpretations,
    using coalescent theory. I further show that the admixture tests can be interpreted
    as testing general properties of phylogenies, allowing extension of some ideas
    applications to arbitrary phylogenetic trees. The new results are used to investigate
    the behavior of the statistics under different models of population structure
    and show how population substructure complicates inference. The results lead to
    simplified estimators in many cases, and I recommend to replaceF3with the average
    number of pairwise differences for estimating population divergence.

  abstract: The dynamics of adaptation is difficult to predict because it is highly
    stochastic even in large populations. The uncertainty emerges from number fluctuations,
    called genetic drift, arising in the small number of particularly fit individuals
    of the population. Random genetic drift in this evolutionary vanguard also limits
    the speed of adaptation, which diverges in deterministic models that ignore these
    chance effects. Several approaches have been developed to analyze the crucial
    role of noise on the expected dynamics of adaptation, including the mean fitness
    of the entire population, or the fate of newly arising beneficial deleterious
    mutations. However, very little is known about how genetic drift causes fluctuations
    to emerge on the population level, including fitness distribution variations and
    speed variations. Yet, these phenomena control the replicability of experimental
    evolution experiments and are key to a truly predictive understanding of evolutionary
    processes. Here, we develop an exact approach to these emergent fluctuations by
    a combination of computational and analytical methods. We show, analytically,
    that the infinite hierarchy of moment equations can be closed at any arbitrary
    order by a suitable choice of a dynamical constraint. This constraint regulates
    (rather than fixes) the population size, accounting for resource limitations.
    The resulting linear equations, which can be accurately solved numerically, exhibit
    fluctuation-induced terms that amplify short-distance correlations and suppress
    long-distance ones. Importantly, by accounting for the dynamics of sub-populations,
    we provide a systematic route to key population genetic quantities, such as fixation
    probabilities and decay rates of the genetic diversity.

    have supported a recent Out-of-Africa dispersal model with minor additional input
    from archaic humans. Here, we present a novel dataset of 379 high-coverage human
    genomes from 125 populations worldwide. The combination of high spatial and genomic
    coverage enabled us to refine current knowledge of continent-wide patterns of
    heterozygosity, long- and short-distance gene flow, archaic admixture, and changes
    in effective population size. Compared to Eurasians, the examined Papuan genomes
    show an excess of highly derived modern human haplotypes and deeper split times
    from Africans. This is compatible with traces of an early and otherwise extinct
    expansion of modern humans Out-of-Africa, as also suggested by the Western Asian
    fossil record and the recent discovery of modern human and Neanderthal admixture
    100 000 years ago which significantly predates the main Out of Africa expansion
    of modern humans. Our tests of positive and balancing selection highlight a number
    of new metabolism- and immunity-related loci as candidates for local adaptation.

  abstract: Advances in the sequencing and the analysis of the genomes of both modern
    and ancient peoples have facilitated a number of breakthroughs in our understanding
    of human evolutionary history. These include the discovery of interbreeding between
    anatomically modern humans and extinct hominins; the development of an increasingly
    detailed description of the complex dispersal of modern humans out of Africa and
    their population expansion worldwide; and the characterization of many of the
    genetic adaptions of humans to local environmental conditions. Our interpretation
    of the evolutionary history and adaptation of humans is being transformed by analyses
    of these new genomic data.

  abstract: Background Rapa Nui (Easter Island), located in the easternmost corner
    of the Polynesian Triangle, is one of the most isolated locations on the planet
    inhabited by humans. Archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the island
    was first colonized by Polynesians around AD 1200, during their eastward expansion.

    evidence has been brought forward supporting the possibility of Native American
    contact prior to the European “discovery” of the island in AD 1722. Results We
    generated genome-wide data for 27 Rapanui. We found a mostly Polynesian ancestry
    among Rapanui and detected genome-wide patterns consistent with Native American
    and European admixture. By considering the distribution of local ancestry tracts
    of eight unrelated Rapanui, we found statistical support for Native American admixture
    dating to AD 1280-1495 and European admixture dating to AD 1850-1895. Conclusions
    These genetic results can be explained by one or more pre-European trans-Pacific

  title: 'The Genome Analysis Toolkit: a MapReduce framework for analyzing next-generation
    DNA sequencing data.'
  container-title: Genome research
  page: '1297-303'
  volume: '20'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes
    Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among
    individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS–the 1000 Genome pilot
    alone includes nearly five terabases–make writing feature-rich, efficient, and
    robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals.
    Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they
    can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating
    the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit
    (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of
    efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the
    functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but
    rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool
    needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure
    enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU
    and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization.
    We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and
    application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single
    nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework
    enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust
    NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing
    projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.

  title: 'Ancient DNA and the human settlement of the Pacific: A review'
  abstract: a b s t r a c t The Pacific region provides unique opportunities to study
    human evolution including through analyses of ancient DNA. While some of the earliest
    studies involving ancient DNA from skeletal remains focused on Pacific samples,
    in the following 25 years, several factors meant that little aDNA research, particularly
    research focused on human populations, has emerged. This paper briefly presents
    the genetic evidence for population origins, reviews what ancient DNA work has
    been undertaken to address human history and evolution in the Pacific region,
    and argues that the future is bright but research requires a collab-orative approach
    between academic disciplines but also with local communities.

  title: A genomic history of Aboriginal Australia
  container-title: Nature
  publisher: Nature Publishing Group
  page: '207-214'
  volume: '538'
  issue: '7624'
  abstract: The population history of Aboriginal Australians remains largely uncharacterized.
    Here we generate high-coverage genomes for 83 Aboriginal Australians (speakers
    of Pama–Nyungan languages) and 25 Papuans from the New Guinea Highlands. We find
    that Papuan and Aboriginal Australian ancestors diversified 25–40 thousand years
    ago (kya), suggesting pre-Holocene population structure in the ancient continent
    of Sahul (Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania). However, all of the studied Aboriginal
    Australians descend from a single founding population that differentiated \~10–32
    kya. We infer a population expansion in northeast Australia during the Holocene
    epoch (past 10,000 years) associated with limited gene flow from this region to
    the rest of Australia, consistent with the spread of the Pama–Nyungan languages.
    We estimate that Aboriginal Australians and Papuans diverged from Eurasians 51–72
    kya, following a single out-of-Africa dispersal, and subsequently admixed with
    archaic populations. Finally, we report evidence of selection in Aboriginal Australians
    potentially associated with living in the desert.

  title: Ancient mitochondrial DNA provides high-resolution timescale of the peopling
    of the Americas
  container-title: Science Advances
  page: '1-10'
  issue: April
  abstract: The exact timing, route, and process of the initial peopling of the Americas
    remains uncertain despitemuch research. Archaeological evidence indicates the
    presence of humans as far as southern Chile by 14.6 thousand years ago (ka), shortly
    after the Pleistocene ice sheets blocking access from eastern Beringia began to
    retreat. Genetic estimates of the timing and route of entry have been constrained
    by the lack of suitable calibration points and low genetic diversityofNativeAmericans.Wesequenced
    92wholemitochondrial genomes from pre-Columbian South American skeletons dating
    from 8.6 to 0.5 ka, allowing a detailed, temporally calibrated reconstruction
    of the peopling of the Americas in a Bayesian coalescent analysis. The data suggest
    that a small population entered the Americas via a coastal route around 16.0 ka,
    following previous isolation in eastern Beringia for \~2.4 to 9 thousand years
    after separation from eastern Siberian populations. Following a rapid movement
    throughout the Americas, limited gene flow in South America resulted in amarked
    phylogeographic structure of populations,which persisted through time. All of
    the ancient mitochondrial lineages detected in this study were absent from modern
    data sets, suggesting a high extinction rate. To investigate this further, we
    applied a novel principal components multiple logistic regression test to Bayesian
    serial coalescent simulations. The analysis supported a scenario in which European
    colonization caused a substantial loss of pre-Columbian lineages.

  title: 'AdapterRemoval: Easy Cleaning of Next Generation Sequencing Reads'
  container-title: BMC Research Notes
  page: '337-337'
  volume: '5'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: With the advent of next-generation sequencing there is
    an increased demand for tools to pre-process and handle the vast amounts of data
    generated. One recurring problem is adapter contamination in the reads, i.e. the
    partial or complete sequencing of adapter sequences. These adapter sequences have
    to be removed as they can hinder correct mapping of the reads and influence SNP
    calling and other downstream analyses.\\n\\nFINDINGS: We present a tool called
    AdapterRemoval which is able to pre-process both single and paired-end data. The
    program locates and removes adapter residues from the reads, it is able to combine
    paired reads if they overlap, and it can optionally trim low-quality nucleotides.
    Furthermore, it can look for adapter sequence in both the 5’ and 3’ ends of the
    reads. This is a flexible tool that can be tuned to accommodate different experimental
    settings and sequencing platforms producing FASTQ files. AdapterRemoval is shown
    to be good at trimming adapters from both single-end and paired-end data.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:
    AdapterRemoval is a comprehensive tool for analyzing next-generation sequencing
    data. It exhibits good performance both in terms of sensitivity and specificity.
    AdapterRemoval has already been used in various large projects and it is possible
    to extend it further to accommodate application-specific biases in the data.'

  container-title: Bioinformatics
  page: '1754-1760'
  volume: '25'
  issue: '14'
  abstract: 'MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new
    DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read
    alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed,
    including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short
    reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment
    for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads
    where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the
    alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.\\n\\nRESULTS:
    We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package
    that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently
    align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human
    genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g.
    from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines.
    Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately
    10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs
    alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling
    and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open
    source SAMtools software package.\\n\\nAVAILABILITY: http://maq.sourceforge.net.'

  abstract: 'Motivation: Most existing methods for DNA sequence analysis rely on
    accurate sequences or genotypes. However, in applications of the next-generation
    sequencing (NGS), accurate genotypes may not be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample
    low-coverage sequencing or somatic mutation discovery). These applications press
    for the development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with uncertainty.
    Results: We present a statistical framework for calling SNPs, discovering somatic
    mutations, inferring population genetical parameters and performing association
    tests directly based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or linkage-based
    imputation. On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy
    to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele
    frequency spectrum and for association mapping. We also highlight the necessity
    of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic mutations and confirm that for
    discovering rare events, mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors.

    Populations
  container-title: Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics
  publisher: Taylor & Francis
  page: '182-194'
  volume: '26'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: A wide range of studies in population genetics have employed the sample
    frequency spectrum (SFS), a summary statistic which describes the distribution
    of mutant alleles at a polymorphic site in a sample of DNA sequences. In particular,
    recently there has been growing interest in analyzing the joint SFS data from
    multiple populations to infer parameters of complex demographic histories, including
    variable population sizes, population split times, migration rates, admixture
    proportions, and so on. Although much methodological progress has been made, existing
    SFS-based inference methods suffer from numerical instability and high computational
    complexity when multiple populations are involved and the sample size is large.
    In this paper, we present new analytic formulas and algorithms that enable efficient
    computation of the expected joint SFS for multiple populations related by a complex
    demographic model with arbitrary population size histories (including piecewise
    exponential growth). Our results are implemented in a new software package called
    momi (MOran Models for Inference). Through an empirical study involving tens of
    populations, we demonstrate our improvements to numerical stability and computational
    complexity.

  title: Inferring the joint demographic history of multiple populations from multidimensional
    SNP frequency data
  container-title: PLoS Genetics
  volume: '5'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: Demographic models built from genetic data play important roles in illuminating
    prehistorical events and serving as null models in genome scans for selection.
    We introduce an inference method based on the joint frequency spectrum of genetic
    variants within and between populations. For candidate models we numerically compute
    the expected spectrum using a diffusion approximation to the one-locus two-allele
    Wright-Fisher process, involving up to three simultaneous populations. Our approach
    is a composite likelihood scheme, since linkage between neutral loci alters the
    variance but not the expectation of the frequency spectrum. We thus use bootstraps
    incorporating linkage to estimate uncertainties for parameters and significance
    values for hypothesis tests. Our method can also incorporate selection on single
    sites, predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles among populations
    experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions,
    migrations, and admixture. As applications, we model human expansion out of Africa
    and the settlement of the New World, using 5 Mb of noncoding DNA resequenced in
    68 individuals from 4 populations (YRI, CHB, CEU, and MXL) by the Environmental
    Genome Project. We also combine our demographic model with a previously estimated
    distribution of selective effects among newly arising amino acid mutations to
    accurately predict the frequency spectrum of nonsynonymous variants across three
    continental populations (YRI, CHB, CEU).

  abstract: Neandertals, the closest evolutionary relatives of present-day humans,
    lived in large parts of Europe and western Asia before disappearing 30,000 years
    ago. We present a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome composed of more than
    4 billion nucleotides from three individuals. Comparisons of the Neandertal genome
    to the genomes of five present-day humans from different parts of the world identify
    a number of genomic regions that may have been affected by positive selection
    in ancestral modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive
    and skeletal development. We show that Neandertals shared more genetic variants
    with present-day humans in Eurasia than with present-day humans in sub-Saharan
    Africa, suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans
    occurred before the divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.

  title: Recovering mitochondrial DNA lineages of extinct Amerindian nations in extant
    homopatric Brazilian populations
  container-title: Investigative Genetics
  page: '13-13'
  volume: '1'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: 'Background: Brazilian Amerindians have experienced a drastic population
    decrease in the past 500 years. Indeed, many native groups from eastern Brazil
    have vanished. However, their mitochondrial mtDNA haplotypes, still persist in
    Brazilians, at least 50 million of whom carry Amerindian mitochondrial lineages.
    Our objective was to test whether, by analyzing extant rural populations from
    regions anciently occupied by specific Amerindian groups, we could identify potentially
    authentic mitochondrial lineages, a strategy we have named ’homopatric targeting’.
    Results: We studied 173 individuals from Queixadinha, a small village located
    in a territory previously occupied by the now extinct Botocudo Amerindian nation.
    Pedigree analysis revealed 74 unrelated matrilineages, which were screened for
    Amerindian mtDNA lineages by restriction fragment length polymorphism. A cosmopolitan
    control group was composed of 100 individuals from surrounding cities. All Amerindian
    lineages identified had their hypervariable segment HVSI sequenced, yielding 13
    Amerindian haplotypes in Queixadinha, nine of which were not present in available
    databanks or in the literature. Among these haplotypes, there was a significant
    excess of haplogroup C (70%) and absence of haplogroup A lineages, which were
    the most common in the control group. The novelty of the haplotypes and the excess
    of the C haplogroup suggested that we might indeed have identified Botocudo lineages.
    To validate our strategy, we studied teeth extracted from 14 ancient skulls of
    Botocudo Amerindians from the collection of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro.
    We recovered mtDNA sequences from all the teeth, identifying only six different
    haplotypes (a low haplotypic diversity of 0.8352 0.0617), one of which was present
    among the lineages observed in the extant individuals studied. Conclusions: These
    findings validate the technique of homopatric targeting as a useful new strategy
    to study the peopling and colonization of the New World, especially when direct
    analysis of genetic material is not possible.'

  issue: '5869'
  abstract: When did humans colonize the Americas? From where did they come and what
    routes did they take? These questions have gripped scientists for decades, but
    until recently answers have proven difficult to find. Current genetic evidence
    implies dispersal from a single Siberian population toward the Bering Land Bridge
    no earlier than about 30,000 years ago (and possibly after 22,000 years ago),
    then migration from Beringia to the Americas sometime after 16,500 years ago.
    The archaeological records of Siberia and Beringia generally support these findings,
    as do archaeological sites in North and South America dating to as early as 15,000
    years ago. If this is the time of colonization, geological data from western Canada
    suggest that humans dispersed along the recently deglaciated Pacific coastline.

  title: High level of inbreeding in final phase of 1000 Genomes Project
  container-title: Scientific Reports

  page: '1-7'
  volume: '5'
  abstract: 'The 1000 Genomes Project provides a unique source of whole genome sequencing
    data for studies of human population genetics and human diseases. The last release
    of this project includes more than 2,500 sequenced individuals from 26 populations.
    Although relationships among individuals have been investigated in some of the
    populations, inbreeding has never been studied. In this article, we estimated
    the genomic inbreeding coefficient of each individual and found an unexpected
    high level of inbreeding in 1000 Genomes data: nearly a quarter of the individuals
    were inbred and around 4% of them had inbreeding coefficients similar or greater
    than the ones expected for first-cousin offspring. Inbred individuals were found
    in each of the 26 populations, with some populations showing proportions of inbred
    individuals above 50%. We also detected 227 previously unreported pairs of close
    relatives (up to and including first-cousins). Thus, we propose subsets of unrelated
    and outbred individuals, for use by the scientific community. In addition, because
    admixed populations are present in the 1000 Genomes Project, we performed simulations
    to study the robustness of inbreeding coefficient estimates in the presence of
    admixture. We found that our multi-point approach (FSuite) was quite robust to
    admixture, unlike single-point methods (PLINK).'

  title: Sambaqui (Shell Mound) Societies of Coastal Brazil
  container-title: The Handbook of South American Archaeology
  page: '319-335'
  abstract: Sambaquis (the Brazilian term for shell mounds, derived from the Tupi
    language) are widely distributed along the shoreline of Brazil and were noted
    in European accounts as early as the sixteenth century. They typically occur in
    highly productive bay and lagoon ecotones where the mingling of salt and fresh
    waters supports mangrove vegetation and abundant shellfish, fish, and aquatic
    birds. More than one thousand sambaqui locations are recorded in Brazil’s national
    register of archaeological sites \[Note 1\], but represent a fraction of the original
    number because colonial through modern settlements coincide with these favorable
    environments. Although sambaquis are of variable scale overall, massive shell
    mounds are characteristic of Brazil’s southern coast (Figure 18.1). The term “sambaqui”
    is applied to cultural deposits of varying size and stratigraphy in which shell
    is a major constituent, undoubtedly encompassing accumulations with a range of
    functions and origins. Proportions of soil, sand, shell \[Note 2\], and the kinds
    of cultural inclusions and features in sambaquis also are variable. Small sambaquis
    often consist of shell layers over sandy substrates or sequences of shell and
    sand layers, with or without signs of burning or significant numbers of artifacts.
    Larger shell mounds typically have horizontally and vertically complex stratigraphy,
    including alternating sequences of shell deposits, narrower and darker layers
    of charcoal and burned bone that mark occupation surfaces, and clusters of burials,
    hearths, and postholes descending from these surfaces.

  title: Identification of Polynesian mtDNA haplogroups in remains of Botocudo Amerindians
    from Brazil
  abstract: There is a consensus that modern humans arrived in the Americas 15,000–20,000
    y ago during the Late Pleistocene, most probably from northeast Asia through Beringia.
    However, there is still debate about the time of entry and number of migratory
    waves, including apparent inconsistencies between genetic and morphological data
    on Paleoa-mericans. Here we report the identification of mitochondrial sequen-ces
    belonging to haplogroups characteristic of Polynesians in DNA extracted from ancient
    skulls of the now extinct Botocudo Indians from Brazil. The identification of
    these two Polynesian haplogroups was confirmed in independent replications in
    Brazil and Denmark, ensuring reliability of the data. Parallel analysis of 12
    other Botocudo individuals yielded only the well-known Amerindian mtDNA hap-logroup
    C1. Potential scenarios to try to help understand these results are presented
    and discussed. The findings of this study may be rele-vant for the understanding
    of the pre-Columbian and/or post-Colum-bian peopling of the Americas. ancient

    determine how deeply to sequence to achieve complete coverage or to predict the
    benefits of additional sequencing are lacking. We introduce an empirical bayesian
    method to accurately characterize the molecular complexity of a DNA sample for
    almost any sequencing application on the basis of limited preliminary sequencing.

  title: A Likelihood-Free Inference Framework for Population Genetic Data using Exchangeable
    Neural Networks
  abstract: Inference for population genetics models is hin-dered by computationally
    intractable likelihoods. While this issue is tackled by likelihood-free meth-ods,
    these approaches typically rely on hand-crafted summary statistics of the data.
    In com-plex settings, designing and selecting suitable summary statistics is problematic
    and results are very sensitive to such choices. In this paper, we learn the first
    exchangeable feature represen-tation for population genetic data to work di-rectly
    with genotype data. This is achieved by means of a novel Bayesian likelihood-free
    infer-ence framework, where a permutation-invariant convolutional neural network
    learns the inverse functional relationship from the data to the poste-rior. We
    leverage access to scientific simulators to learn such likelihood-free function
    mappings, and establish a general framework for inference in a variety of simulation-based
    tasks. We demon-strate the power of our method on the recombina-tion hotspot testing
    problem, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

  title: The phylogeography of Brazilian Y-chromosome lineages.
  container-title: American journal of human genetics
  page: '281-6'
  volume: '68'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: We examined DNA polymorphisms in the nonrecombining portion of the Y-chromosome
    to investigate the contribution of distinct patrilineages to the present-day white
    Brazilian population. Twelve unique-event polymorphisms were typed in 200 unrelated
    males from four geographical regions of Brazil and in 93 Portuguese males. In
    our Brazilian sample, the vast majority of Y-chromosomes proved to be of European
    origin. Indeed, there were no significant differences when the haplogroup frequencies
    in Brazil and Portugal were compared by means of an exact test of population differentiation.
    Y-chromosome typing was quite sensitive in the detection of regional immigration
    events. Distinct footprints of Italian immigration to southern Brazil, migration
    of Moroccan Jews to the Amazon region, and possible relics of the 17th-century
    Dutch invasion of northeast Brazil could be seen in the data. In sharp contrast
    with our mtDNA data in white Brazilians, which showed that &gt; or =60% of the
    matrilineages were Amerindian or African, only 2.5% of the Y-chromosome lineages
    were from sub-Saharan Africa, and none were Amerindian. Together, these results
    configure a picture of strong directional mating between European males and Amerindian
    and African females, which agrees with the known history of the peopling of Brazil
    since 1500.

  page: '337-360'
  volume: '51'
  issue: '01'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt; If radiocarbon measurements are to be used at all for chronological
    purposes, we have to use statistical methods for calibration. The most widely
    used method of calibration can be seen as a simple application of Bayesian statistics,
    which uses both the information from the new measurement and information from
    the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; C calibration curve. In most dating applications,
    however, we have larger numbers of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; C measurements and
    we wish to relate those to events in the past. Bayesian statistics provides a
    coherent framework in which such analysis can be performed and is becoming a core
    element in many &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; C dating projects. This article gives
    an overview of the main model components used in chronological analysis, their
    mathematical formulation, and examples of how such analyses can be performed using
    the latest version of the OxCal software (v4). Many such models can be put together,
    in a modular fashion, from simple elements, with defined constraints and groupings.
    In other cases, the commonly used “uniform phase” models might not be appropriate,
    and ramped, exponential, or normal distributions of events might be more useful.
    When considering analyses of these kinds, it is useful to be able run simulations
    on synthetic data. Methods for performing such tests are discussed here along
    with other methods of diagnosing possible problems with statistical models of
    this kind. &lt;/p&gt;'

    from 12 cal kBP (cal kBP is here defined as thousands of calibrated years before
    AD 1950), and extended to 50 cal kBP, utilizing newly available data sets that
    meet the IntCal Working Group criteria for pristine corals and other carbonates
    and for quantification of uncertainty in both the 14C and calendar timescales
    as established in 2002. No change was made to the curves from 012 cal kBP. The
    curves were constructed using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation
    of the random walk model used for IntCal04 and Marine04. The new curves were ratified
    at the 20th International Radiocarbon Conference in June 2009 and are available
    in the Supplemental Material at www.radiocarbon.org.

  abstract: We have analyzed 247 Brazilian mtDNAs for hypervariable segment (HVS)-I
    and selected restriction fragment-length-polymorphism sites, to assess their ancestry
    in different continents. The total sample showed nearly equal amounts of Native
    American, African, and European matrilineal genetic contribution but with regional
    differences within Brazil. The mtDNA pool of present-day Brazilians clearly reflects
    the imprints of the early Portuguese colonization process (involving directional
    mating), as well as the recent immigrant waves (from Europe) of the last century.
    The subset of 99 mtDNAs from the southeastern region encompasses nearly all mtDNA
    haplogroups observed in the total Brazilian sample; for this regional subset,
    HVS-II was analyzed, providing, in particular, some novel details of the African
    mtDNA phylogeny.
