# Scripts related to Botocudos' project

This repository hosts the scripts and instructions to obtain the results from
the Botocudos' project.

The analysis were done in the (not necessary strict) following order:

* Maps
* Mapping
* DataQuality
* Sex_determination
* Damage
* Contamination
* Isotopes
* MDS
* GenoLike
* Admixture
* Relatedness
* Dstat
* Plotting

Other scripts that were useful to me are found under misc/

The folder Quack/ contains scripts related to the analysis of the human DNA.

We obtained the FASTQ files from the sequencing facility in
Copenhagen. The files are stored under:

/home/dcruzdva/archive/FASTQ/Botocudo

and organized into directories depending on the day on which
they were downloaded.
