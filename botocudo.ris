Genetic studies, mostly using uniparentally inherited DNA, have shed some light on human origins in Oceania, particularly indicating that Polynesians are of mixed East Asian and Near Oceanian ancestry. Here, we use ∼1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to investigate the demographic history of Oceania in a more detailed manner. Results: We developed a new approach to account for SNP ascertainment bias, used approximate Bayesian computation simulations to choose the best-fitting model of population history, and estimated demographic parameters. We find that the ancestors of Near Oceanians diverged from ancestral Eurasians ∼27 thousand years ago (kya), suggesting separate initial occupations of both territories. The genetic admixture in Polynesian history between East Asians (∼87%) and Near Oceanians (∼13%) occurred ∼3 kya, prior to the colonization of Polynesia. Fijians are of Polynesian (∼65%) and additional Near Oceanian (∼35%) ancestry not found in Polynesians, with this admixture occurring considerably after the initial settlement of Remote Oceania. Our data support a greater contribution of East Asian women than men in the admixture history of Remote Oceania and highlight population substructure in Polynesia and New Guinea. Conclusions: Despite the inherent ascertainment bias, genome-wide SNP data provide new insights into the genetic history of Oceana. Our approach to correct for ascertainment bias and obtain reliable inferences concerning demographic history should prove useful in other such studies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Human Genetics: Pre-Columbian Pacific ContactA1  - Tyler-Smith, ChrisY1  - 2014///DO  - 10.1016/j.cub.2014.09.019UR  - http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0960982214011397/1-s2.0-S0960982214011397-main.pdf?_tid=622094d0-8f13-11e7-a69d-00000aacb35e&acdnat=1504270087_7bdc11b638d9bd17839a96d72fb53b01L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Tyler-Smith - 2014 - Human Genetics Pre-Columbian Pacific Contact.pdfN2  - Large-scale genetic analysis of the native inhabitants of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) reveals the expected combination of Polynesian ancestry with later European admixture, but also a contribution from Native Americans dating to 1280–1495 AD, demonstrating early trans-Pacific contact.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Genetic Evidence for a Contribution of Native Americans to the Early Settlement of Rapa Nui (Easter Island)A1  - Thorsby, ErikY1  - 2016/10//KW  - Early settlementKW  - Easter IslandKW  - EuropeaansKW  - Native AmericansKW  - PolynesiansKW  - Rapa NuiPB  - FrontiersJF  - Frontiers in Ecology and EvolutionVL  - 4SP  - 118EP  - 118DO  - 10.3389/fevo.2016.00118UR  - http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2016.00118/fullL1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Thorsby - 2016 - Genetic Evidence for a Contribution of Native Americans to the Early Settlement of Rapa Nui (Easter Island).pdfN2  - Available evidence strongly suggests that the first to settle on Rapa Nui were Polynesians arriving from the west around AD 1200-1253. There are, however, also signs of an early contact between Rapa Nui and South America, but genetic evidence of an early contribution of Native Americans to the peopling of Rapa Nui has until recently been lacking. In this review our own genetic studies of blood-derived DNA collected on Rapa Nui since 1971 are summarized. For the first time human molecular genetic data are obtained which strongly suggest that some Native Americans arrived early at Rapa Nui, probably as early as AD 1280-1495. Whether they sailed directly from South America to Rapa Nui on their own rafts or whether they came with Polynesians returning from visits to South America cannot be established by our studies, but the latter possibility may be the most likely given other evidence of early visits by Polynesians to South America. In any case, our data suggest that some Native Americans arrived Rapa Nui not long after its first settlement by Polynesians, but long before the island was discovered by Europeans in 1722. Native Americans may therefore have had an influence on the early human colonization of Rapa Nui and thus on its ecology.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Estimation of population divergence times from SNP data and a test for treenessA1  - Theunert, ChristophY1  - 2018///KW  - 0 international licenseKW  - 10KW  - 1101KW  - 14KW  - 2018KW  - 281881KW  - aKW  - bKW  - biorxiv preprint first postedKW  - coalescence theoryKW  - denisovansKW  - doiKW  - dxKW  - estimation of divergence timesKW  - fKW  - from snp dataKW  - funderKW  - httpKW  - is the authorKW  - it is made availableKW  - neanderthalsKW  - online marKW  - orgKW  - peer-reviewedKW  - running headKW  - the copyright holder forKW  - this preprintKW  - under a cc-by 4KW  - which was notL1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/281881.full.pdfER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Early Holocene ritual complexity in South America: the archaeological record of Lapa do Santo (east-central Brazil)A1  - Strauss, AndréA1  - Oliveira, Rodrigo EliasA1  - Villagran, Ximena S.A1  - Bernardo, Danilo V.A1  - Salazar-García, Domingo C.A1  - Bissaro, Marcos CésarA1  - Pugliese, FranciscoA1  - Hermenegildo, TiagoA1  - Santos, RafaelA1  - Barioni, AlbertoA1  - de Oliveira, Emiliano CastroA1  - Moreno de Sousa, João CarlosA1  - Jaouen, KlerviaA1  - Ernani, MaxA1  - Hubbe, MarkA1  - Inglez, MarianaA1  - Gratão, MarinaA1  - Rockwell, H.A1  - Machado, MárciaA1  - de Souza, GustavoA1  - Chemale, FaridA1  - Kawashita, KojiA1  - O'Connell, Tamsin C.A1  - Israde, IsabelA1  - Feathers, JamesA1  - Campi, ClaudioA1  - Richards, MichaelA1  - Wahl, JoachimA1  - Kipnis, RenatoA1  - Araujo, AstolfoA1  - Neves, WalterY1  - 2016///KW  - brazilKW  - early archaic periodKW  - lagoa santaKW  - lapa do santoKW  - mortuaryKW  - palaeoindianJF  - AntiquityVL  - 90IS  - 354SP  - 1454EP  - 1473DO  - 10.15184/aqy.2016.220UR  - https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0003598X16002209/type/journal_articleL1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/early_holocene_ritual_complexity_in_south_america_the_archaeological_record_of_lapa_do_santo_eastcentral_brazil.pdfN2  - <p> <fig position="anchor"> <graphic href="S0003598X16002209_figab" mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" position="float" type="simple"/> </fig> </p>ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - The cranial morphology of the Botocudo Indians, BrazilA1  - Strauss, AndréA1  - Hubbe, MarkA1  - Neves, Walter A.A1  - Bernardo, Danilo V.A1  - Atuí, João Paulo V.Y1  - 2015/06//KW  - Lagoa SantaKW  - PaleoamericanKW  - cranial morphologyKW  - settlement of the AmericasJF  - American Journal of Physical AnthropologyVL  - 157IS  - 2SP  - 202EP  - 216DO  - 10.1002/ajpa.22703UR  - http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ajpa.22703L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/Papers/Strauss_et_al-2015-American_Journal_of_Physical_Anthropology.pdfER  - TY  - BOOKT1  - The native population of South AmericaA1  - Steward, J.

With next generation sequencing technologies it is possible to obtain genetic data for all accessible genetic variations in the genome. Existing methods for admixture analysis rely on known genotypes. However, individual genotypes cannot be inferred from low-depth sequencing data without introducing errors. This article presents a new method for inferring an individual's ancestry that takes the uncertainty introduced in next generation sequencing data into account. This is achieved by working directly with genotype likelihoods that contain all relevant information of the unobserved genotypes. Using simulations as well as publicly available sequencing data, we demonstrate that the presented method has great accuracy even for very low-depth data. At the same time, we demonstrate that applying existing methods to genotypes called from the same data can introduce severe biases. The presented method is implemented in the NGSadmix software available at http://www.popgen.dk/software.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - A genomic view of the peopling of the AmericasA1  - Skoglund, PontusA1  - Reich, DavidY1  - 2016///JF  - Current Opinion in Genetics and DevelopmentVL  - 41SP  - 27EP  - 35DO  - 10.1016/j.gde.2016.06.016L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Skoglund, Reich - 2016 - A genomic view of the peopling of the Americas.pdfN2  - Whole-genome studies have documented that most Native American ancestry stems from a single population that diversified within the continent more than twelve thousand years ago. However, this shared ancestry hides a more complex history whereby at least four distinct streams of Eurasian migration have contributed to present-day and prehistoric Native American populations. Whole genome studies enhanced by technological breakthroughs in ancient DNA now provide evidence of a sequence of events involving initial migrations from a structured Northeast Asian source population with differential relatedness to present-day Australasian populations, followed by a divergence into northern and southern Native American lineages. During the Holocene, new migrations from Asia introduced the Saqqaq/Dorset Paleoeskimo population to the North American Arctic ∼4500 years ago, ancestry that is potentially connected with ancestry found in Athabaskan-speakers today. This was then followed by a major new population turnover in the high Arctic involving Thule-related peoples who are the ancestors of present-day Inuit. We highlight several open questions that could be addressed through future genomic research.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Genomic insights into the peopling of the Southwest PacificA1  - Skoglund, PontusA1  - Posth, CosimoA1  - Sirak, KendraA1  - Spriggs, MatthewA1  - Valentin, FrederiqueA1  - Bedford, StuartA1  - Clark, Geoffrey R.A1  - Reepmeyer, ChristianA1  - Petchey, FionaA1  - Fernandes, DanielA1  - Fu, QiaomeiA1  - Harney, EadaoinA1  - Lipson, MarkA1  - Mallick, SwapanA1  - Novak, MarioA1  - Rohland, NadinA1  - Stewardson, KristinA1  - Abdullah, SyafiqA1  - Cox, Murray P.A1  - Friedlaender, Françoise R.A1  - Friedlaender, Jonathan S.A1  - Kivisild, ToomasA1  - Koki, GeorgeA1  - Kusuma, PradiptajatiA1  - Merriwether, D.

However, the relationship of these pioneers to the long-established Papuan people of the New Guinea region is unclear. Here we present genome-wide ancient DNA data from three individuals from Vanuatu (about 3,100-2,700 years before present) and one from Tonga (about 2,700-2,300 years before present), and analyse them with data from 778 present-day East Asians and Oceanians. Today, indigenous people of the South Pacific harbour a mixture of ancestry from Papuans and a population of East Asian origin that no longer exists in unmixed form, but is a match to the ancient individuals. Most analyses have interpreted the minimum of twenty-five per cent Papuan ancestry in the region today as evidence that the first humans to reach Remote Oceania, including Polynesia, were derived from population mixtures near New Guinea, before their further expansion into Remote Oceania. However, our finding that the ancient individuals had little to no Papuan ancestry implies that later human population movements spread Papuan ancestry through the South Pacific after the first peopling of the islands.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Supplementary information Genomic insights into the peopling of the Southwest PacificA1  - Skoglund, PontusA1  - Posth, CosimoA1  - Sirak, KendraA1  - Spriggs, MatthewA1  - Valentin, FrederiqueA1  - Bedford, StuartA1  - Clark, Geoffrey R.A1  - Reepmeyer, ChristianA1  - Petchey, FionaA1  - Fernandes, DanielA1  - Fu, QiaomeiA1  - Harney, EadaoinA1  - Lipson, MarkA1  - Mallick, SwapanA1  - Novak, MarioA1  - Rohland, NadinA1  - Stewardson, KristinA1  - Abdullah, SyafiqA1  - Cox, Murray P.A1  - Friedlaender, Françoise R.A1  - Friedlaender, Jonathan S.A1  - Kivisild, ToomasA1  - Koki, GeorgeA1  - Kusuma, PradiptajatiA1  - Merriwether, D.

In this study, we demonstrate elevated kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80 primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen. Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha) may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Genetic evidence for two founding populations of the Americas.A1  - Skoglund, PontusA1  - Mallick, SwapanA1  - Bortolini, Maria CátiraA1  - Chennagiri, NiruA1  - Hünemeier, TábitaA1  - Petzl-Erler, Maria LuizaA1  - Salzano, Francisco MauroA1  - Patterson, NickA1  - Reich, DavidY1  - 2015/09//JF  - NatureVL  - 525IS  - 7567SP  - 104EP  - 8DO  - 10.1038/nature14895UR  - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26196601UR  - http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4982469L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Skoglund et al. - 2015 - Genetic evidence for two founding populations of the Americas.pdfN2  - Genetic studies have consistently indicated a single common origin of Native American groups from Central and South America. However, some morphological studies have suggested a more complex picture, whereby the northeast Asian affinities of present-day Native Americans contrast with a distinctive morphology seen in some of the earliest American skeletons, which share traits with present-day Australasians (indigenous groups in Australia, Melanesia, and island Southeast Asia). Here we analyse genome-wide data to show that some Amazonian Native Americans descend partly from a Native American founding population that carried ancestry more closely related to indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andaman Islanders than to any present-day Eurasians or Native Americans. This signature is not present to the same extent, or at all, in present-day Northern and Central Americans or in a ∼12,600-year-old Clovis-associated genome, suggesting a more diverse set of founding populations of the Americas than previously accepted.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Supplementary information Genetic evidence for two founding populations of the Americas.A1  - Skoglund, PontusA1  - Mallick, SwapanA1  - Bortolini, Maria CátiraA1  - Chennagiri, NiruA1  - Hünemeier, TábitaA1  - Petzl-Erler, Maria LuizaA1  - Salzano, Francisco MauroA1  - Patterson, NickA1  - Reich, DavidY1  - 2015///JF  - NatureVL  - 525IS  - 7567SP  - 5985EP  - 5991SN  - 0008-5472 (Print)\r0008-5472 (Linking)DO  - 10.1038/natureL1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Skoglund et al. - 2015 - Supplementary information Genetic evidence for two founding populations of the Americas.pdfER  - TY  - JOURT1  - DNA sequencing at 40: Past, present and futureA1  - Shendure, JayA1  - Balasubramanian, ShankarA1  - Church, George M.A1  - Gilbert, WalterA1  - Rogers, JaneA1  - Schloss, Jeffery A.A1  - Waterston, Robert H.Y1  - 2017///PB  - Nature Publishing GroupJF  - NatureVL  - 550IS  - 7676SN  - 1476-4687 (Electronic)DO  - 10.1038/nature24286UR  - http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24286L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/nature24286-2.pdfN2  - This review commemorates the 40th anniversary of DNA sequencing, a period in which we have already witnessed multiple technological revolutions and a growth in scale from a few kilobases to the first human genome, and now to millions of human and a myriad of other genomes.

Here we present the results of a small, preliminary isotopic study that was conducted in order to determine the geographical origin of 25 enslaved Africans who were buried at the Newton plantation, Barbados, sometime between the late 17th and early 19th century. In order to gain a more nuanced understanding of the slaves' origin, we used a combination of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and strontium isotope analyses. Carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios were determined in bone and dentinal collagen; oxygen and strontium isotopes were measured in tooth enamel. Results suggest that the majority of individuals were born on the island, if not the estate itself. Seven individuals, however, yielded enamel oxygen and strontium ratios that are inconsistent with a Barbadian origin, which strongly suggests that we are dealing with first-generation captives who were brought to the island with the slave trade. This idea is also supported by the fact that their carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values differ markedly between their teeth and bones. These intra-skeletal shifts reflect major dietary changes that probably coincided with their enslavement and forced migration to Barbados. While it is impossible to determine their exact origins, the results clearly demonstrate that the slaves did not all grow up in the same part of Africa. Instead, the data seem to suggest that they originated from at least three different areas, possibly including the Gold Coast and the Senegambia.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Assessing the Relationship of Ancient and Modern Populations.A1  - Schraiber, Joshua GY1  - 2018/01//KW  - SNP dataKW  - ancient DNAKW  - diffusion theoryKW  - population continuityJF  - GeneticsVL  - 208IS  - 1SP  - 383EP  - 398DO  - 10.1534/genetics.117.300448UR  - http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/04/113779UR  - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29167200UR  - http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5753871L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/383.full.pdfN2  - Genetic material sequenced from ancient samples is revolutionizing our understanding of the recent evolutionary past. However, ancient DNA is often degraded, resulting in low coverage, error-prone sequencing. Several solutions exist to this problem, ranging from simple approach, such as selecting a read at random for each site, to more complicated approaches involving genotype likelihoods. In this work, we present a novel method for assessing the relationship of an ancient sample with a modern population, while accounting for sequencing error and postmortem damage by analyzing raw reads from multiple ancient individuals simultaneously. We show that, when analyzing SNP data, it is better to sequence more ancient samples to low coverage: two samples sequenced to 0.5× coverage provide better resolution than a single sample sequenced to 2× coverage. We also examined the power to detect whether an ancient sample is directly ancestral to a modern population, finding that, with even a few high coverage individuals, even ancient samples that are very slightly diverged from the modern population can be detected with ease. When we applied our approach to European samples, we found that no ancient samples represent direct ancestors of modern Europeans. We also found that, as shown previously, the most ancient Europeans appear to have had the smallest effective population sizes, indicating a role for agriculture in modern population growth.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - The Evolution of Science in a Latin-American Country : Genetics and Genomics in BrazilA1  - Salzano, Francisco MY1  - 2018///KW  - animal geneticsKW  - geneticsKW  - genomicsKW  - genomics in brazilKW  - human geneticsKW  - molecularKW  - plant geneticsKW  - science historyVL  - 208IS  - MarchSP  - 823EP  - 832DO  - 10.1534/genetics.118.300690L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/823.full.pdfER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Schmutzi: estimation of contamination and endogenous mitochondrial consensus calling for ancient DNAA1  - Renaud, GabrielA1  - Slon, VivianeA1  - Duggan, Ana T.A1  - Kelso, JanetY1  - 2015///PB  - Genome BiologyJF  - Genome BiologyVL  - 16IS  - 1SP  - 224EP  - 224DO  - 10.1186/s13059-015-0776-0UR  - http://genomebiology.com/2015/16/1/224L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Renaud et al. - 2015 - Schmutzi estimation of contamination and endogenous mitochondrial consensus calling for ancient DNA.pdfN2  - Ancient DNA is typically highly degraded with appreciable cytosine deamination, and contamination with present-day DNA often complicates the identification of endogenous molecules. Together, these factors impede accurate assembly of the endogenous ancient mitochondrial genome. We present schmutzi, an iterative approach to jointly estimate present-day human contamination in ancient human DNA datasets and reconstruct the endogenous mitochondrial genome. By using sequence deamination patterns and fragment length distributions, schmutzi accurately reconstructs the endogenous mitochondrial genome sequence even when contamination exceeds 50 %. Given sufficient coverage, schmutzi also produces reliable estimates of contamination across a range of contamination rates.

One contentious issue is whether the settlement occurred by means of a single migration or multiple streams of migration from Siberia. The pattern of dispersals within the Americas is also poorly understood. To address these questions at a higher resolution than was previously possible, we assembled data from 52 Native American and 17 Siberian groups genotyped at 364,470 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Here we show that Native Americans descend from at least three streams of Asian gene flow. Most descend entirely from a single ancestral population that we call 'First American'. However, speakers of Eskimo-Aleut languages from the Arctic inherit almost half their ancestry from a second stream of Asian gene flow, and the Na-Dene-speaking Chipewyan from Canada inherit roughly one-tenth of their ancestry from a third stream. We show that the initial peopling followed a southward expansion facilitated by the coast, with sequential population splits and little gene flow after divergence, especially in South America. A major exception is in Chibchan speakers on both sides of the Panama isthmus, who have ancestry from both North and South America.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Supplementary information An Aboriginal Australian Genome Reveals Separate Human Dispersals into AsiaA1  - Rasmussen, M.A1  - Guo, X.A1  - Wang, Y.A1  - Lohmueller, K.

We detect no evidence of European admixture and estimate contamination levels to be below 0.5%. We show that Aboriginal Australians are descendants of an early human dispersal into eastern Asia, possibly 62,000 to 75,000 years ago. This dispersal is separate from the one that gave rise to modern Asians 25,000 to 38,000 years ago. We also find evidence of gene flow between populations of the two dispersal waves prior to the divergence of Native Americans from modern Asian ancestors. Our findings support the hypothesis that present-day Aboriginal Australians descend from the earliest humans to occupy Australia, likely representing one of the oldest continuous populations outside Africa.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - An Aboriginal Australian Genome Reveals Separate Human Dispersals into AsiaA1  - Rasmussen, M.A1  - Guo, X.A1  - Wang, Y.A1  - Lohmueller, K.

These models require the prior for the underlying processes that are being described to be defined, including the distribution of underlying events. Chronological information is also incorporated into Bayesian models used in DNA research, with the use of Skyline plots to show demographic trends. Despite these advances, there remain difficulties in assessing whether data conform to the assumed underlying models, and in dealing with the type of artifacts seen in Sum plots. In addition, existing methods are not applicable for situations where it is not possible to quantify the underlying process, or where sample selection is thought to have filtered the data in a way that masks the original event distribution. In this paper three different approaches are compared: “Sum” distributions, postulated undated events, and kernel density approaches. Their implementation in the OxCal program is described and their suitability for visualizing the results from chronological and geographic analyses considered for cases with and without useful prior information. The conclusion is that kernel density analysis is a powerful method that could be much more widely applied in a wide range of dating applications. </p>ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans.A1  - Raghavan, MaanasaA1  - Skoglund, PontusA1  - Graf, Kelly EA1  - Metspalu, MaitA1  - Albrechtsen, AndersA1  - Moltke, IdaA1  - Rasmussen, SimonA1  - Stafford, Thomas WA1  - Orlando, LudovicA1  - Metspalu, EneA1  - Karmin, MonikaA1  - Tambets, KristiinaA1  - Rootsi, SiiriA1  - Mägi, ReedikA1  - Campos, Paula FA1  - Balanovska, ElenaA1  - Balanovsky, OlegA1  - Khusnutdinova, ElzaA1  - Litvinov, SergeyA1  - Osipova, Ludmila PA1  - Fedorova, Sardana AA1  - Voevoda, Mikhail IA1  - DeGiorgio, MichaelA1  - Sicheritz-Ponten, ThomasA1  - Brunak, SørenA1  - Demeshchenko, SvetlanaA1  - Kivisild, ToomasA1  - Villems, RichardA1  - Nielsen, RasmusA1  - Jakobsson, MattiasA1  - Willerslev, EskeY1  - 2014/01//JF  - NatureVL  - 505IS  - 7481SP  - 87EP  - 91DO  - 10.1038/nature12736UR  - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24256729UR  - http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4105016L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Raghavan et al. - 2014 - Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans.pdfN2  - The origins of the First Americans remain contentious. Although Native Americans seem to be genetically most closely related to east Asians, there is no consensus with regard to which specific Old World populations they are closest to. Here we sequence the draft genome of an approximately 24,000-year-old individual (MA-1), from Mal'ta in south-central Siberia, to an average depth of 1×. To our knowledge this is the oldest anatomically modern human genome reported to date. The MA-1 mitochondrial genome belongs to haplogroup U, which has also been found at high frequency among Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers, and the Y chromosome of MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and near the root of most Native American lineages. Similarly, we find autosomal evidence that MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and genetically closely related to modern-day Native Americans, with no close affinity to east Asians. This suggests that populations related to contemporary western Eurasians had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought. Furthermore, we estimate that 14 to 38% of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population. This is likely to have occurred after the divergence of Native American ancestors from east Asian ancestors, but before the diversification of Native American populations in the New World. Gene flow from the MA-1 lineage into Native American ancestors could explain why several crania from the First Americans have been reported as bearing morphological characteristics that do not resemble those of east Asians. Sequencing of another south-central Siberian, Afontova Gora-2 dating to approximately 17,000 years ago, revealed similar autosomal genetic signatures as MA-1, suggesting that the region was continuously occupied by humans throughout the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings reveal that western Eurasian genetic signatures in modern-day Native Americans derive not only from post-Columbian admixture, as commonly thought, but also from a mixed ancestry of the First Americans.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans.A1  - Raghavan, MaanasaA1  - Skoglund, PontusA1  - Graf, Kelly EA1  - Metspalu, MaitA1  - Albrechtsen, AndersA1  - Moltke, IdaA1  - Rasmussen, SimonA1  - Stafford, Thomas WA1  - Orlando, LudovicA1  - Metspalu, EneA1  - Karmin, MonikaA1  - Tambets, KristiinaA1  - Rootsi, SiiriA1  - Mägi, ReedikA1  - Campos, Paula FA1  - Balanovska, ElenaA1  - Balanovsky, OlegA1  - Khusnutdinova, ElzaA1  - Litvinov, SergeyA1  - Osipova, Ludmila PA1  - Fedorova, Sardana AA1  - Voevoda, Mikhail IA1  - DeGiorgio, MichaelA1  - Sicheritz-Ponten, ThomasA1  - Brunak, SørenA1  - Demeshchenko, SvetlanaA1  - Kivisild, ToomasA1  - Villems, RichardA1  - Nielsen, RasmusA1  - Jakobsson, MattiasA1  - Willerslev, EskeY1  - 2014/01//JF  - NatureVL  - 505IS  - 7481SP  - 87EP  - 91DO  - 10.1038/nature12736UR  - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24256729UR  - http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4105016L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Raghavan et al. - 2014 - Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans.pdfN2  - The origins of the First Americans remain contentious.

We present genome-wide sequence data from ancient and present-day humans from Greenland, Arctic Canada, Alaska, Aleutian Islands, and Siberia. We show that Paleo-Eskimos (~3000 BCE to 1300 CE) represent a migration pulse into the Americas independent of both Native American and Inuit expansions. Furthermore, the genetic continuity characterizing the Paleo-Eskimo period was interrupted by the arrival of a new population, representing the ancestors of present-day Inuit, with evidence of past gene flow between these lineages. Despite periodic abandonment of major Arctic regions, a single Paleo-Eskimo metapopulation likely survived in near-isolation for more than 4000 years, only to vanish around 700 years ago.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Supplementary information Genomic evidence for the Pleistocene and recent population history of Native AmericansA1  - Raghavan, M.A1  - Steinrucken, M.A1  - Harris, K.A1  - Schiffels, S.A1  - Rasmussen, S.A1  - DeGiorgio, M.A1  - Albrechtsen, A.A1  - Valdiosera, C.A1  - Avila-Arcos, M.

We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

We describe a method that enables explicit detection and correction of population stratification on a genome-wide scale. Our method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls. The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations. Our simple, efficient approach can easily be applied to disease studies with hundreds of thousands of markers.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Admixture, Population Structure, and F-StatisticsA1  - Peter, Benjamin M.Y1  - 2016/04//KW  - AdmixtureKW  - Gene flowKW  - Phylogenetic networkKW  - PhylogeneticsKW  - Population geneticsJF  - GeneticsVL  - 202IS  - 4SP  - 1485EP  - 1501SN  - 1943-2631 (Electronic)\r0016-6731 (Linking)DO  - 10.1534/genetics.115.183913UR  - http://www.genetics.org/cgi/doi/10.1534/genetics.115.183913L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/1485.full.pdfN2  - Many questions about human genetic history can be addressed by examining the patterns of shared genetic variation between sets of populations. A useful methodological framework for this purpose isF-statistics that measure shared genetic drift between sets of two, three, and four populations and can be used to test simple and complex hypotheses about admixture between populations. This article provides context from phylogenetic and population genetic theory. I review howF-statistics can be interpreted as branch lengths or paths and derive new interpretations, using coalescent theory. I further show that the admixture tests can be interpreted as testing general properties of phylogenies, allowing extension of some ideas applications to arbitrary phylogenetic trees. The new results are used to investigate the behavior of the statistics under different models of population structure and show how population substructure complicates inference. The results lead to simplified estimators in many cases, and I recommend to replaceF3with the average number of pairwise differences for estimating population divergence.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Admixture, Population Structure, and F-StatisticsA1  - Peter, B.

The uncertainty emerges from number fluctuations, called genetic drift, arising in the small number of particularly fit individuals of the population. Random genetic drift in this evolutionary vanguard also limits the speed of adaptation, which diverges in deterministic models that ignore these chance effects. Several approaches have been developed to analyze the crucial role of noise on the expected dynamics of adaptation, including the mean fitness of the entire population, or the fate of newly arising beneficial deleterious mutations. However, very little is known about how genetic drift causes fluctuations to emerge on the population level, including fitness distribution variations and speed variations. Yet, these phenomena control the replicability of experimental evolution experiments and are key to a truly predictive understanding of evolutionary processes. Here, we develop an exact approach to these emergent fluctuations by a combination of computational and analytical methods. We show, analytically, that the infinite hierarchy of moment equations can be closed at any arbitrary order by a suitable choice of a dynamical constraint. This constraint regulates (rather than fixes) the population size, accounting for resource limitations. The resulting linear equations, which can be accurately solved numerically, exhibit fluctuation-induced terms that amplify short-distance correlations and suppress long-distance ones.

Here, we present a novel dataset of 379 high-coverage human genomes from 125 populations worldwide. The combination of high spatial and genomic coverage enabled us to refine current knowledge of continent-wide patterns of heterozygosity, long- and short-distance gene flow, archaic admixture, and changes in effective population size. Compared to Eurasians, the examined Papuan genomes show an excess of highly derived modern human haplotypes and deeper split times from Africans. This is compatible with traces of an early and otherwise extinct expansion of modern humans Out-of-Africa, as also suggested by the Western Asian fossil record and the recent discovery of modern human and Neanderthal admixture 100 000 years ago which significantly predates the main Out of Africa expansion of modern humans. Our tests of positive and balancing selection highlight a number of new metabolism- and immunity-related loci as candidates for local adaptation.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Tracing the peopling of the world through genomicsA1  - Nielsen, RasmusA1  - Akey, Joshua M.A1  - Jakobsson, MattiasA1  - Pritchard, Jonathan K.A1  - Tishkoff, SarahA1  - Willerslev, EskeY1  - 2017///JF  - NatureVL  - 541IS  - 7637SP  - 302EP  - 310SN  - 0028-0836DO  - 10.1038/nature21347UR  - http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature21347L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Nielsen et al. - 2017 - Tracing the peopling of the world through genomics.pdfN2  - Advances in the sequencing and the analysis of the genomes of both modern and ancient peoples have facilitated a number of breakthroughs in our understanding of human evolutionary history.

However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Ancient DNA and the human settlement of the Pacific: A reviewA1  - Matisoo-Smith, ElizabethY1  - 2015///KW  - Commensal modelsKW  - Human migrationKW  - LapitaKW  - PolynesiaKW  - SahulDO  - 10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.10.017UR  - http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0047248414002632/1-s2.0-S0047248414002632-main.pdf?_tid=da6c7986-8f13-11e7-bacd-00000aacb362&acdnat=1504270290_d809508f74b263f45387c991e7727faeL1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Matisoo-Smith - 2015 - Ancient DNA and the human settlement of the Pacific A review.pdfN2  - a b s t r a c t The Pacific region provides unique opportunities to study human evolution including through analyses of ancient DNA. While some of the earliest studies involving ancient DNA from skeletal remains focused on Pacific samples, in the following 25 years, several factors meant that little aDNA research, particularly research focused on human populations, has emerged. This paper briefly presents the genetic evidence for population origins, reviews what ancient DNA work has been undertaken to address human history and evolution in the Pacific region, and argues that the future is bright but research requires a collab-orative approach between academic disciplines but also with local communities.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - LONG Supplementary Information Two ancient human genomes reveal Polynesian ancestry among the indigenous Botocudos of BrazilA1  - Malaspinas, Anna-SapfoA1  - Westaway, Michael C.A1  - Muller, CraigA1  - Sousa, Vitor C.A1  - Lao, OscarA1  - Alves, IsabelA1  - Bergström, AndersA1  - Athanasiadis, GeorgiosA1  - Cheng, Jade Y.A1  - Crawford, Jacob E.A1  - Heupink, Tim H.A1  - Macholdt, EnricoA1  - Peischl, StephanA1  - Rasmussen, SimonA1  - Schiffels, StephanA1  - Subramanian, SankarA1  - Wright, Joanne L.A1  - Albrechtsen, AndersA1  - Barbieri, ChiaraA1  - Dupanloup, IsabelleA1  - Eriksson, AndersA1  - Margaryan, AshotA1  - Moltke, IdaA1  - Pugach, IrinaA1  - Korneliussen, Thorfinn S.A1  - Levkivskyi, Ivan P.A1  - Moreno-Mayar, J.

Here we generate high-coverage genomes for 83 Aboriginal Australians (speakers of Pama–Nyungan languages) and 25 Papuans from the New Guinea Highlands. We find that Papuan and Aboriginal Australian ancestors diversified 25–40 thousand years ago (kya), suggesting pre-Holocene population structure in the ancient continent of Sahul (Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania). However, all of the studied Aboriginal Australians descend from a single founding population that differentiated ~10–32 kya. We infer a population expansion in northeast Australia during the Holocene epoch (past 10,000 years) associated with limited gene flow from this region to the rest of Australia, consistent with the spread of the Pama–Nyungan languages. We estimate that Aboriginal Australians and Papuans diverged from Eurasians 51–72 kya, following a single out-of-Africa dispersal, and subsequently admixed with archaic populations. Finally, we report evidence of selection in Aboriginal Australians potentially associated with living in the desert.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - bammds: a tool for assessing the ancestry of low-depth whole-genome data using multidimensional scaling (MDS)A1  - Malaspinas, Anna SapfoA1  - Tange, OleA1  - Moreno-Mayar, José VíctorA1  - Rasmussen, MortenA1  - DeGiorgio, MichaelA1  - Wang, YongA1  - Valdiosera, Cristina E.A1  - Politis, GustavoA1  - Willerslev, EskeA1  - Nielsen, RasmusY1  - 2014///JF  - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)VL  - 30IS  - 20SP  - 2962EP  - 2964DO  - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu410L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Malaspinas et al. - 2014 - bammds a tool for assessing the ancestry of low-depth whole-genome data using multidimensional scaling (MDS).pdfN2  - SUMMARY: We present bammds, a practical tool that allows visualization of samples sequenced by second-generation sequencing when compared with a reference panel of individuals (usually genotypes) using a multidimensional scaling algorithm.

Archaeological evidence indicates the presence of humans as far as southern Chile by 14.6 thousand years ago (ka), shortly after the Pleistocene ice sheets blocking access from eastern Beringia began to retreat. Genetic estimates of the timing and route of entry have been constrained by the lack of suitable calibration points and low genetic diversityofNativeAmericans.Wesequenced 92wholemitochondrial genomes from pre-Columbian South American skeletons dating from 8.6 to 0.5 ka, allowing a detailed, temporally calibrated reconstruction of the peopling of the Americas in a Bayesian coalescent analysis. The data suggest that a small population entered the Americas via a coastal route around 16.0 ka, following previous isolation in eastern Beringia for ~2.4 to 9 thousand years after separation from eastern Siberian populations. Following a rapid movement throughout the Americas, limited gene flow in South America resulted in amarked phylogeographic structure of populations,which persisted through time. All of the ancient mitochondrial lineages detected in this study were absent from modern data sets, suggesting a high extinction rate. To investigate this further, we applied a novel principal components multiple logistic regression test to Bayesian serial coalescent simulations. The analysis supported a scenario in which European colonization caused a substantial loss of pre-Columbian lineages.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - AdapterRemoval: Easy Cleaning of Next Generation Sequencing ReadsA1  - Lindgreen, StinusY1  - 2012///KW  - adapter trimmingKW  - data pre-processingKW  - next-generation sequencingKW  - paired-endKW  - readsKW  - sequence alignmentKW  - single-end readsJF  - BMC Research NotesVL  - 5IS  - 1SP  - 337EP  - 337SN  - 1756-0500DO  - 10.1186/1756-0500-5-337UR  - http://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-0500-5-337L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/1756-0500-5-337.pdfN2  - BACKGROUND: With the advent of next-generation sequencing there is an increased demand for tools to pre-process and handle the vast amounts of data generated. One recurring problem is adapter contamination in the reads, i.e. the partial or complete sequencing of adapter sequences. These adapter sequences have to be removed as they can hinder correct mapping of the reads and influence SNP calling and other downstream analyses.\n\nFINDINGS: We present a tool called AdapterRemoval which is able to pre-process both single and paired-end data. The program locates and removes adapter residues from the reads, it is able to combine paired reads if they overlap, and it can optionally trim low-quality nucleotides. Furthermore, it can look for adapter sequence in both the 5' and 3' ends of the reads. This is a flexible tool that can be tuned to accommodate different experimental settings and sequencing platforms producing FASTQ files. AdapterRemoval is shown to be good at trimming adapters from both single-end and paired-end data.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: AdapterRemoval is a comprehensive tool for analyzing next-generation sequencing data. It exhibits good performance both in terms of sensitivity and specificity. AdapterRemoval has already been used in various large projects and it is possible to extend it further to accommodate application-specific biases in the data.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transformA1  - Li, HengA1  - Durbin, RichardY1  - 2009///JF  - BioinformaticsVL  - 25IS  - 14SP  - 1754EP  - 1760SN  - 1367-4811 (Electronic)\r1367-4803 (Linking)DO  - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp324L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/btp324.pdfN2  - MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.\n\nRESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.\n\nAVAILABILITY: http://maq.sourceforge.net.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - A statistical framework for SNP calling, mutation discovery, association mapping and population genetical parameter estimation from sequencing dataA1  - Li, HengY1  - 2011///JF  - BioinformaticsVL  - 27IS  - 21SP  - 2987EP  - 2993SN  - 1367-4811 (Electronic)\r1367-4803 (Linking)DO  - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btr509L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/btr509.pdfN2  - Motivation: Most existing methods for DNA sequence analysis rely on accurate sequences or genotypes. However, in applications of the next-generation sequencing (NGS), accurate genotypes may not be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or somatic mutation discovery). These applications press for the development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with uncertainty. Results: We present a statistical framework for calling SNPs, discovering somatic mutations, inferring population genetical parameters and performing association tests directly based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or linkage-based imputation. On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping. We also highlight the necessity of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic mutations and confirm that for discovering rare events, mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors.

In particular, recently there has been growing interest in analyzing the joint SFS data from multiple populations to infer parameters of complex demographic histories, including variable population sizes, population split times, migration rates, admixture proportions, and so on. Although much methodological progress has been made, existing SFS-based inference methods suffer from numerical instability and high computational complexity when multiple populations are involved and the sample size is large. In this paper, we present new analytic formulas and algorithms that enable efficient computation of the expected joint SFS for multiple populations related by a complex demographic model with arbitrary population size histories (including piecewise exponential growth). Our results are implemented in a new software package called momi (MOran Models for Inference). Through an empirical study involving tens of populations, we demonstrate our improvements to numerical stability and computational complexity.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - FastNGSadmix: Admixture proportions and principal component analysis of a single NGS sampleA1  - Jørsboe, EmilA1  - Hanghøj, KristianA1  - Albrechtsen, AndersY1  - 2017///JF  - BioinformaticsVL  - 33IS  - 19SP  - 3148EP  - 3150DO  - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btx474L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Jørsboe, Hanghøj, Albrechtsen - 2017 - FastNGSadmix Admixture proportions and principal component analysis of a single NGS sample.pdfER  - TY  - ICOMMT1  - Encyclopedia of Indigenous People in BrazilA1  - Instituto SociambientalUR  - https://pib.socioambiental.org/enER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Environmental selection during the last ice age on the mother-to-infant transmission of vitamin D and fatty acids through breast milkA1  - Hlusko, Leslea JA1  - Carlson, Joshua PA1  - Chaplin, GeorgeA1  - Elias, Scott AA1  - Hoffecker, John FA1  - Huffman, MichaelaY1  - 2018///DO  - 10.1073/pnas.1711788115L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/1711788115.full.pdfER  - TY  - GENT1  - Ancient bone DNA amplified.A1  - Hagelberg, EA1  - Sykes, BA1  - Hedges, RY1  - 1989///JF  - NatureVL  - 342IS  - 6249SP  - 485EP  - 485SN  - 0028-0836DO  - 10.1038/342485a0UR  - http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/342485a0%5Cnhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2586623L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/342485a0.pdfN2  - Reports the successful extraction and amplification of DNA from human bones between 300 and 5500 years of age.

We introduce an inference method based on the joint frequency spectrum of genetic variants within and between populations. For candidate models we numerically compute the expected spectrum using a diffusion approximation to the one-locus two-allele Wright-Fisher process, involving up to three simultaneous populations. Our approach is a composite likelihood scheme, since linkage between neutral loci alters the variance but not the expectation of the frequency spectrum. We thus use bootstraps incorporating linkage to estimate uncertainties for parameters and significance values for hypothesis tests. Our method can also incorporate selection on single sites, predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles among populations experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions, migrations, and admixture. As applications, we model human expansion out of Africa and the settlement of the New World, using 5 Mb of noncoding DNA resequenced in 68 individuals from 4 populations (YRI, CHB, CEU, and MXL) by the Environmental Genome Project. We also combine our demographic model with a previously estimated distribution of selective effects among newly arising amino acid mutations to accurately predict the frequency spectrum of nonsynonymous variants across three continental populations (YRI, CHB, CEU).ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - A Draft Sequence of the Neandertal GenomeA1  - Green, R.

Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of five present-day humans from different parts of the world identify a number of genomic regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive and skeletal development. We show that Neandertals shared more genetic variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than with present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - A Draft Sequence of the Neandertal GenomeA1  - Green, R.

Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of five present-day humans from different parts of the world identify a number of genomic regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive and skeletal development. We show that Neandertals shared more genetic variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than with present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Craniometric evidenc for palaeoamerican survival in Baja CaliforniaA1  - González-José, RolandoA1  - González-Martín, AntonioA1  - Hernández, MiguelA1  - Pucciarelli, Héctor MA1  - Sardi, MarinaA1  - Rosales, AlfonsoA1  - van der Molen, SilvinaY1  - 2003///KW  - At UCBJF  - NatureVL  - 425IS  - SEPTEMBERSP  - 62EP  - 65DO  - 10.1038/nature01923.1.L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/González-José et al. - 2003 - Craniometric evidenc for palaeoamerican survival in Baja California.pdfER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Recovering mitochondrial DNA lineages of extinct Amerindian nations in extant homopatric Brazilian populationsA1  - Gonçalves, Vanessa FA1  - Parra, Flavia CA1  - Gonçalves-Dornelas, HiggorA1  - Rodrigues-Carvalho, ClaudiaA1  - Silva, Hilton PA1  - Pena, Sergio DJY1  - 2010///JF  - Investigative GeneticsVL  - 1IS  - 1SP  - 13EP  - 13SN  - 2041-2223DO  - 10.1186/2041-2223-1-13UR  - http://investigativegenetics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-2223-1-13L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Gonçalves et al. - 2010 - Recovering mitochondrial DNA lineages of extinct Amerindian nations in extant homopatric Brazilian population.pdfN2  - Background: Brazilian Amerindians have experienced a drastic population decrease in the past 500 years. Indeed, many native groups from eastern Brazil have vanished. However, their mitochondrial mtDNA haplotypes, still persist in Brazilians, at least 50 million of whom carry Amerindian mitochondrial lineages. Our objective was to test whether, by analyzing extant rural populations from regions anciently occupied by specific Amerindian groups, we could identify potentially authentic mitochondrial lineages, a strategy we have named 'homopatric targeting'. Results: We studied 173 individuals from Queixadinha, a small village located in a territory previously occupied by the now extinct Botocudo Amerindian nation. Pedigree analysis revealed 74 unrelated matrilineages, which were screened for Amerindian mtDNA lineages by restriction fragment length polymorphism. A cosmopolitan control group was composed of 100 individuals from surrounding cities. All Amerindian lineages identified had their hypervariable segment HVSI sequenced, yielding 13 Amerindian haplotypes in Queixadinha, nine of which were not present in available databanks or in the literature. Among these haplotypes, there was a significant excess of haplogroup C (70%) and absence of haplogroup A lineages, which were the most common in the control group. The novelty of the haplotypes and the excess of the C haplogroup suggested that we might indeed have identified Botocudo lineages. To validate our strategy, we studied teeth extracted from 14 ancient skulls of Botocudo Amerindians from the collection of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. We recovered mtDNA sequences from all the teeth, identifying only six different haplotypes (a low haplotypic diversity of 0.8352 ± 0.0617), one of which was present among the lineages observed in the extant individuals studied. Conclusions: These findings validate the technique of homopatric targeting as a useful new strategy to study the peopling and colonization of the New World, especially when direct analysis of genetic material is not possible.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - The late Pleistocene dispersal of modern humans in the americansA1  - Goebel, T.A1  - Waters, M.A1  - O'Rourke, D.Y1  - 2008///JF  - ScienceVL  - 319IS  - 5869SP  - 1497EP  - 1502DO  - 10.1126/science.1153569UR  - http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5869/1497.shortL1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/1497.full.pdfN2  - When did humans colonize the Americas? From where did they come and what routes did they take? These questions have gripped scientists for decades, but until recently answers have proven difficult to find. Current genetic evidence implies dispersal from a single Siberian population toward the Bering Land Bridge no earlier than about 30,000 years ago (and possibly after 22,000 years ago), then migration from Beringia to the Americas sometime after 16,500 years ago. The archaeological records of Siberia and Beringia generally support these findings, as do archaeological sites in North and South America dating to as early as 15,000 years ago. If this is the time of colonization, geological data from western Canada suggest that humans dispersed along the recently deglaciated Pacific coastline.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - High level of inbreeding in final phase of 1000 Genomes ProjectA1  - Gazal, StevenA1  - Sahbatou, MouradA1  - Babron, Marie ClaudeA1  - Genin, EmmanuelleA1  - Leutenegger, Anne LouiseY1  - 2015///PB  - Nature Publishing GroupJF  - Scientific ReportsVL  - 5SP  - 1EP  - 7SN  - 2045-2322 (Electronic)2045-2322 (Linking)DO  - 10.1038/srep17453UR  - http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep17453L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/srep17453.pdfN2  - The 1000 Genomes Project provides a unique source of whole genome sequencing data for studies of human population genetics and human diseases. The last release of this project includes more than 2,500 sequenced individuals from 26 populations. Although relationships among individuals have been investigated in some of the populations, inbreeding has never been studied. In this article, we estimated the genomic inbreeding coefficient of each individual and found an unexpected high level of inbreeding in 1000 Genomes data: nearly a quarter of the individuals were inbred and around 4% of them had inbreeding coefficients similar or greater than the ones expected for first-cousin offspring. Inbred individuals were found in each of the 26 populations, with some populations showing proportions of inbred individuals above 50%. We also detected 227 previously unreported pairs of close relatives (up to and including first-cousins). Thus, we propose subsets of unrelated and outbred individuals, for use by the scientific community. In addition, because admixed populations are present in the 1000 Genomes Project, we performed simulations to study the robustness of inbreeding coefficient estimates in the presence of admixture. We found that our multi-point approach (FSuite) was quite robust to admixture, unlike single-point methods (PLINK).ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Sambaqui (Shell Mound) Societies of Coastal BrazilA1  - Gaspar, Maria DulceA1  - DeBlasis, PauloA1  - Fish, Suzanne K.A1  - Fish, Paul R.Y1  - 2008///JF  - The Handbook of South American ArchaeologySP  - 319EP  - 335SN  - 978-0-387-74907-5DO  - 10.1007/978-0-387-74907-5_18UR  - http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-0-387-74907-5_18L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/gaspar2008.pdfN2  - Sambaquis (the Brazilian term for shell mounds, derived from the Tupi language) are widely distributed along the shoreline of Brazil and were noted in European accounts as early as the sixteenth century. They typically occur in highly productive bay and lagoon ecotones where the mingling of salt and fresh waters supports mangrove vegetation and abundant shellfish, fish, and aquatic birds. More than one thousand sambaqui locations are recorded in Brazil’s national register of archaeological sites [Note 1], but represent a fraction of the original number because colonial through modern settlements coincide with these favorable environments. Although sambaquis are of variable scale overall, massive shell mounds are characteristic of Brazil’s southern coast (Figure 18.1). The term “sambaqui” is applied to cultural deposits of varying size and stratigraphy in which shell is a major constituent, undoubtedly encompassing accumulations with a range of functions and origins. Proportions of soil, sand, shell [Note 2], and the kinds of cultural inclusions and features in sambaquis also are variable. Small sambaquis often consist of shell layers over sandy substrates or sequences of shell and sand layers, with or without signs of burning or significant numbers of artifacts. Larger shell mounds typically have horizontally and vertically complex stratigraphy, including alternating sequences of shell deposits, narrower and darker layers of charcoal and burned bone that mark occupation surfaces, and clusters of burials, hearths, and postholes descending from these surfaces.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Supplemental Information A Revised Timescale for Human Evolution Based on Ancient Mitochondrial GenomesA1  - Fu, QiaomeiA1  - Mittnik, AlissaA1  - Johnson, Philip L FA1  - Bos, KirstenA1  - Lari, MartinaA1  - Bollongino, RuthA1  - Sun, ChengkaiA1  - Giemsch, LianeA1  - Schmitz, RalfA1  - Burger, JoachimA1  - Ronchitelli, Anna MariaA1  - Martini, FabioA1  - Cremonesi, Renata GA1  - Svoboda, JiříA1  - Bauer, PeterA1  - Caramelli, DavidA1  - Castellano, SergiA1  - Reich, DavidA1  - Pääbo, SvanteA1  - Krause, JohannesY1  - 2013///JF  - Current BiologyVL  - 23L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Fu et al. - 2013 - Supplemental Information A Revised Timescale for Human Evolution Based on Ancient Mitochondrial Genomes(3).pdfER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Identification of Polynesian mtDNA haplogroups in remains of Botocudo Amerindians from BrazilA1  - Faria Gonçalves, VanessaA1  - Stenderup, JesperA1  - Rodrigues-Carvalho, CláudiaA1  - Silva, Hilton PA1  - Gonçalves-Dornelas, HiggorA1  - Líryo, AndersenA1  - Kivisild, ToomasA1  - Malaspinas, Anna-SapfoA1  - Campos, Paula FA1  - Rasmussen, MortenA1  - Willerslev, EskeA1  - Danilo, SergioA1  - Pena, JDO  - 10.1073/pnas.1217905110UR  - http://www.pnas.org/content/110/16/6465.full.pdf?with-ds=yesL1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Faria Gonçalves et al. - Unknown - Identification of Polynesian mtDNA haplogroups in remains of Botocudo Amerindians from Brazil.pdfN2  - There is a consensus that modern humans arrived in the Americas 15,000–20,000 y ago during the Late Pleistocene, most probably from northeast Asia through Beringia. However, there is still debate about the time of entry and number of migratory waves, including apparent inconsistencies between genetic and morphological data on Paleoa-mericans. Here we report the identification of mitochondrial sequen-ces belonging to haplogroups characteristic of Polynesians in DNA extracted from ancient skulls of the now extinct Botocudo Indians from Brazil. The identification of these two Polynesian haplogroups was confirmed in independent replications in Brazil and Denmark, ensuring reliability of the data. Parallel analysis of 12 other Botocudo individuals yielded only the well-known Amerindian mtDNA hap-logroup C1. Potential scenarios to try to help understand these results are presented and discussed. The findings of this study may be rele-vant for the understanding of the pre-Columbian and/or post-Colum-bian peopling of the Americas. ancient DNA | human migration | mitochondrial DNA | South America |ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Predicting the molecular complexity of sequencing libraries.A1  - Daley, TimothyA1  - Smith, Andrew DY1  - 2013///KW  - AnimalsKW  - Bayes TheoremKW  - CloningKW  - DNAKW  - DNA: methodsKW  - DatabasesKW  - Gene LibraryKW  - GeneticKW  - GenomicsKW  - Genomics: methodsKW  - HumansKW  - ModelsKW  - MolecularKW  - Pan troglodytesKW  - Pan troglodytes: geneticsKW  - Sequence AnalysisKW  - StatisticalJF  - Nature methodsVL  - 10IS  - 4SP  - 325EP  - 7SN  - 1548-7105 (Electronic)\n1548-7091 (Linking)DO  - 10.1038/nmeth.2375UR  - http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3612374&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract%5Cnhttp://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nmeth.2375L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Daley, Smith - 2013 - Predicting the molecular complexity of sequencing libraries.pdfN2  - Predicting the molecular complexity of a genomic sequencing library is a critical but difficult problem in modern sequencing applications.

While this issue is tackled by likelihood-free meth-ods, these approaches typically rely on hand-crafted summary statistics of the data. In com-plex settings, designing and selecting suitable summary statistics is problematic and results are very sensitive to such choices. In this paper, we learn the first exchangeable feature represen-tation for population genetic data to work di-rectly with genotype data. This is achieved by means of a novel Bayesian likelihood-free infer-ence framework, where a permutation-invariant convolutional neural network learns the inverse functional relationship from the data to the poste-rior. We leverage access to scientific simulators to learn such likelihood-free function mappings, and establish a general framework for inference in a variety of simulation-based tasks. We demon-strate the power of our method on the recombina-tion hotspot testing problem, outperforming the state-of-the-art.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - The phylogeography of Brazilian Y-chromosome lineages.A1  - Carvalho-Silva, D RA1  - Santos, F RA1  - Rocha, JA1  - Pena, S DY1  - 2001///JF  - American journal of human geneticsVL  - 68IS  - 1SP  - 281EP  - 6SN  - 0002-9297 (Print)\r0002-9297 (Linking)DO  - 10.1086/316931UR  - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11090340%5Cnhttp://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC1234928L1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Carvalho-Silva et al. - 2001 - The phylogeography of Brazilian Y-chromosome lineages.pdfN2  - We examined DNA polymorphisms in the nonrecombining portion of the Y-chromosome to investigate the contribution of distinct patrilineages to the present-day white Brazilian population. Twelve unique-event polymorphisms were typed in 200 unrelated males from four geographical regions of Brazil and in 93 Portuguese males. In our Brazilian sample, the vast majority of Y-chromosomes proved to be of European origin. Indeed, there were no significant differences when the haplogroup frequencies in Brazil and Portugal were compared by means of an exact test of population differentiation. Y-chromosome typing was quite sensitive in the detection of regional immigration events. Distinct footprints of Italian immigration to southern Brazil, migration of Moroccan Jews to the Amazon region, and possible relics of the 17th-century Dutch invasion of northeast Brazil could be seen in the data. In sharp contrast with our mtDNA data in white Brazilians, which showed that > or =60% of the matrilineages were Amerindian or African, only 2.5% of the Y-chromosome lineages were from sub-Saharan Africa, and none were Amerindian. Together, these results configure a picture of strong directional mating between European males and Amerindian and African females, which agrees with the known history of the peopling of Brazil since 1500.ER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Beagle 3.3.2A1  - Browning, Brian LY1  - 2011///IS  - OctoberL1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/beagle_3.3.2_31Oct11.pdfER  - TY  - JOURT1  - Bayesian Analysis of Radiocarbon DatesA1  - Bronk Ramsey, ChristopherY1  - 2009///JF  - RadiocarbonVL  - 51IS  - 01SP  - 337EP  - 360SN  - 0033-8222DO  - 10.1017/S0033822200033865UR  - https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0033822200033865/type/journal_articleL1  - file:///Users/dcruz/Downloads/bronk_ramsey_2009_bayesian_analysis_radiocarbon.pdfN2  - <p> If radiocarbon measurements are to be used at all for chronological purposes, we have to use statistical methods for calibration. The most widely used method of calibration can be seen as a simple application of Bayesian statistics, which uses both the information from the new measurement and information from the <sup>14</sup> C calibration curve. In most dating applications, however, we have larger numbers of <sup>14</sup> C measurements and we wish to relate those to events in the past. Bayesian statistics provides a coherent framework in which such analysis can be performed and is becoming a core element in many <sup>14</sup> C dating projects. This article gives an overview of the main model components used in chronological analysis, their mathematical formulation, and examples of how such analyses can be performed using the latest version of the OxCal software (v4). Many such models can be put together, in a modular fashion, from simple elements, with defined constraints and groupings. In other cases, the commonly used “uniform phase” models might not be appropriate, and ramped, exponential, or normal distributions of events might be more useful. When considering analyses of these kinds, it is useful to be able run simulations on synthetic data. Methods for performing such tests are discussed here along with other methods of diagnosing possible problems with statistical models of this kind. </p>ER  - TY  - GENT1  - VolA1  - Britannica, EncyclopaediaY1  - 1911///JF  - XXIV, 11th ed.
